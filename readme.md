## Angular 1.5 Component Architecture App

This is a sample skeleton app to show how to use the new Angular 1.5 component architecture where everything is a component. Including
the main component ```<bees-knees></bees-knees>```. The app uses the new component router from Angular 2, compatible with 1.5.

It uses ES6 as the programming language, SASS for styles, Webpack as the build tool, and eslint configured with the Airbnb rules.

You might want to remove the ```no-console: 0``` rule from the ```.eslintrc``` file. I left it there because of all the ```console.log```
statements in the home component to show the new lifecycle hooks that angular provides.

Use this project as a quick way to start a new project from scratch, just ```git clone``` it, ```npm install```, and ```npm start```.
