## Angular Minesweeper

Different versions of the Minesweeper game I love and hate all entirely made in Angular.

The master branch last commit has the Angular 1.5 version of the game made with ES6 and .component(). Since then I've branched out each version and added the github pages branch to host all of them. So far only 1.5 is public but I will make both the Angular v2 and Angular v2+NGRX versions public soon.
